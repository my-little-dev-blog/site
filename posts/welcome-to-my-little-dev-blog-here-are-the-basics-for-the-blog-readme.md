# Welcome to my-little-dev-blog! Here are the basics.

## About

- This is a blog where I share knowledge related to my work.
- Topics will largely be related to data science, AI, and rapid functional prototyping.
- All are welcome to contribute.

## Purpose

- Many helped me throughout my career. I hope to pay it forward.
- I benefit from the knowledge others share every day. I hope to contribute.
- I really enjoy interacting with others who are into what I am into.
- Blogging improves the quality of my work.

## How to use

### In general
- Go to the [home page](https://my-little-dev-blog.github.io/site/)
- Find a post you like
- Scan or read it
- Do one or more of the things in the ["How to contribute"](#how-to-contribute) section below

### Along the way
- Use tools such as ChatGPT and Perpexity -- and, of course, Google
- For example:
  - Don't understand something? Copy / paste into Chat. Interact. Use Google to validate.
  - Wish there was more context? Same.
  - Want to learn more about something? Same.
  - Want to Chat with a post instead of read it? Same.
  - Want to get a summary of the most up-to-date info on the web about this topic and find related sources? Same, except use Perplexity.
- Be sure you have at least basic familiarity with at least ChatGPT and Perplexity prior to reading the posts
